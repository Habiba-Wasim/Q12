//12. Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names: string [] = ["taha", "tayyab", "wasim"];

let message: string = "where are you going?";

console.log(names[0] + " " + message)
console.log(names[1] + " " + message)
console.log(names[2] + " " + message)
